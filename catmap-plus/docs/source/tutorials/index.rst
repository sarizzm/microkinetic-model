============

This page presents a collection of tutorials. It is suggested that first-time
users follow the numbered tutorials sequentially since they are aimed at
teaching basic usage of the software. Tutorials 1-3 focus on constructing a
"scaled" model as a function of descriptor space, and are the core tutorials.
The other tutorials explore some additional features and do not need to be
followed sequentially. These will also be updated as new features are added.
