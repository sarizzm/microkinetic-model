Troubleshooting
================


Where to get help when things go wrong :

- post an issue on `Github <http://github.com/ajmedford/catmap/issues>`_
- mail to the mailling list mkm-developers-request@lists.stanford.edu

In either case by as specific as possible about how to reproduce your problem. Write concrete steps (step 1., step 2., step. 3, ..)
required for doing so. Please post details of your installation (operating system, python version, version of used libraries) if
you think it may have to do with your problem.


Frequently Asked Questions
----------------------------


- What does CatMAP stand for ?

  CatMAP is an acronym for **Cat**\ alysis **M**\ icrokinetic **A**\ nalysis **P**\ ackage. It is also
  an allusion to Richard Feynman's anecdote regarding a \"map of a cat\".

- How can I cite CatMAP?

  If you find CatMAP useful in your research please cite:

  A.J. Medford et. al. CatMAP: A Software Package for Descriptor-Based Microkinetic Mapping of Catalytic Trends.
  Catalysis Letters, 145, 3, pp 794-807 `<dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10562-015-1495-6>`_

  One goal of CatMAP is to increase the transparency, repeatability, and accessibility of descriptor-based kinetic
  models. To this end, if you find CatMAP useful in your research we would appreciate it if you make your input
  files available for others to use. You can do this by including the inputs in the supplementary information
  of publications, and/or sharing the inputs with developers after publication so that they can be made public.

- How can I contribute to CatMAP?

  We are always happy to have new developers! There is lots of coding to be done on CatMAP for good Python programmers,
  and lots of documentation for those who don't like programming. If you are interested please get in touch with the
  developers at `mkm-developers@lists.stanford.edu <mailto:mkm-developers@lists.stanford.edu>`_.
