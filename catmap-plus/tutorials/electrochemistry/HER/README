To run this tutorial, run:

python mkm_job.py

The voltage (in RHE) of this model is specified as a model parameter in HER.mkm much like
temperature and total pressure.

In addition to the standard production rate and coverage plots, we also plot the directional rates,
which can be used to calculate exchange current densities for electrochemical products.

Data contained in HER_input.txt was generated calculations performed by Andrew A. Peterson 
and Joseph H. Montoya.  The ORR tutorial goes into more detail about how one might 
generate such a file.

Notice that because adsorbate-adsorbate interactions are not in place, the peak of the 
volcano appears to be near Cu rather than the expected Pt.  This is a necessary aspect 
of HER to predict the correct peak.  See Skulason et al. (2010)  DOI: 10.1021/jp1048887
