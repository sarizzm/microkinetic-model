The scripts in this directory should replicate the results found in Hansen et al. (2014) 
DOI: 10.1021/jp4100608, which studied the oxygen reduction reaction on Pt(111) and similar 
surfaces using a made-from-scratch steady state microkinetics model.  
An explanation of the provided files are as follows roughly in order of when they should be used:

make_input.py:  this python script generates ORR_input.txt, the input file for this model.  
The input file contains gas, adsorbate, and transition state free energies as described in
Hansen et al. (2014).  Since all species are already free energy corrected, no further vibrations
or corrections need to be specified.  For adsorbate and transition state energies, fictitious
surfaces are generated near the *OH binding energy of Pt(111) from the scaling provided in 
the paper.  Point "d", which has been relabeled to "Pt" is the relevant point for Pt(111)

ORR.mkm:  the template for the .mkm input for this model.  The voltage is set to 0.9V vs RHE,
but you can change this.  This file contains the same reaction expressions and prefactors used in 
the paper as well as the same activity/fugacities which are fed into the rate equations.  
Electrochemical transition states are defined in the form "^0.26eV_a", which is shorthand
for expressing a free energy barrier of 0.26 eV at thermal neutral.  Electrochemical transition
state energies may also be expressed explicitly, but it is not recommended.
O2_dl is described as being on a fictitious "dl" site on every surface with the same energy.  
Note there is a second descriptor of *H binding energy despite that reaction having no real
importance in ORR.  This is currently a necessary constraint of CatMAP, but simply having it there
and giving it a resolution of 1 in the y-direction should cleanly allow a 1D volcano and other
plots to be generated.  Frozen gas, Frozen adsorbate and simple (as opposed to hbond)
electrochemical modes are chosen because the input file already contains all necessary corrections.
The more typical way to do electrochemistry with catmap would be to use ideal gas, harmonic
adsorbate, and hbond_electrochemical (or hbond_with_estimates_electrochemical) as the corrections
to be applied to raw electronic energies in the input file.  

mkm_job.py: the main python script to run the model.  After completing 
the calculation, plots for coverage, rate, and production rate will be generated.
